# CrookhamHacklab Computer Vision Workshop

This workshop is aimed at KS3 and above and intends to introduce the ideas of what machine learning can do with respect to image recognition.

It borrows from the excellent work done in the face_recognition project that can be found here [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)

## Task 1

Task 1 introduces the idea of using python code to take a picture with a camera

## Task 2

Task 2 takes the image from the first task and tries to recognise a face within it. I then displays the face it found.

## Task 3

In task 3 we tie both of the previous tasks together and try to recognise our face again from the camera using the image from the first task as a reference.
